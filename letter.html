    <h1>For You</h1>

    <p class="letter-text">
    I just wanted to say how much I appreciate you.
    <br><br>
    Not just for the big things.
    <br>
    But for the small, quiet things too.
    <br><br>
    The way you support me.
    <br>
    The way you make me laugh.
    <br>
    The way you are there for me.
    <br><br>
    You make ordinary days feel special.
    <br>
    You make stressful days feel lighter.
    <br><br>
    With you, things feel safe.
    <br>
    Easy. Real.
    <br><br>
    Thank you for being exactly who you are.
    <br><br>
    I’m really lucky to have you.
    <br><br>
    I hope you always remember —
    <br>
    you are deeply appreciated,
    <br>
    genuinely admired,
    <br>
    and very, very loved.
    <br><br>
    Happy Valentine’s Day ❤️
